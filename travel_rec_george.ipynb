      "Here are some reviews about Miami Beach. Use them to help create a list of things to do there:\n",
      "Amazing city with diversity and energy. Appreciation of properties exceeds most of the nation, so the housing market is expensive. Schools? City has two above average elementary schools, North Beach Elem (located actually in mid-beach) and South Pointe Elem. The high school has a Intl Baccalaureate program. South Beach is a tourist mess these days with high crime and dirty streets. Mid Beach is the sleepy suburban area. North Beach is more affordable, but residents have to use private schools or finagle a way into other public schools.\n",
      "Miami Beach was a wonderful experience in my life. I had the opportunity to live in a place that felt like home, with the beach, locals and people full of life.In this location you will be able to feel the true experience of living in Miami. You have food, clothing and entertainment stores on every corner. On the other hand, sometimes there are homeless, which is not the best, but they are respectful and not disturbing at all. In conclusion, for me this place left a huge mark on me; I would love to be able to return and live here again in the future.\n",
      "I loved the outdoor life and green love that is commonly seen around Miami Beach. Everywhere you go there's a vibe like no other. Residents love to go to the beach, roller skate, exercise, and overall spend each of their days as an ongoing party as if they were on vacation each and every week. However, I have noticed that in my community there is a grave issue with homelessness, particularly regarding individuals with appeared mental impairment, and I would love to see these individuals in my community be taken care of in centers where they can get appropriate treatment, resources like counseling, and participate in programs to recuperate their life.\n",
      "North Beach is great for families. Quiet neighborhoods. Easy access to the beach and lots of space for walking.\n",
      "Miami Beach is one of the most walkable cities. It should be one of the most bicycle friendly too but the reviews are mixed. I lived there as a child and of course its grown and is a huge spring break place. That can be good to some and bad for others. My biggest concern is that it will be under water in the not-too-distant future. I've read every scientific and news article and in sum they paint a negative future- street heightening is controversial but seems helpful. Real estate of course is going to suffer. Although my name is Fischer it does not mean I want to swim everywhere.\n",
      "I've lived in Miami Beach for 15 years and I just love it because of how many vibrant areas there are around town. You can bike anywhere you want with the green-paved bike lanes and because of the proximity of the different services and locales that Miami beach has to offer.\n",

      "I may be biased, but believe me there is no other place quite like \"the 305,\" or known more commonly as Miami Beach. Hip Hop meets the beach, Wynwood art and palm trees, make the typical Miamian. though I've lived in many, many places; no place has felt like home till I came here.\n",
      "Miami Beach is a beautiful city with lots of diversity in which you can meet people of various backgrounds. You can also enjoy the beach and the parks located near the area which are both entertaining and family-friendly. What I would like to see change in the city would be the overall cleanliness of the streets. Moreover, I would like to see inflation go down in order for prices to be more in line with people's wages.\n",
      "Safety has to be improved for residents and tourists. Unfortunately the perception of the city as a vacation and party area provides unsecure environments.\n",
      "I love the beauty of the city. I'd like to see more diversity and acceptance of all races in Miami Beach. As the population is heavily of Latino descent, I feel they are disproportionately represented in positions of power here in this city.\n",
      "I like that it is a pedestrian friendly city and that we have a nice beach. I like diversity and I find that living here.\n",
      "Great place to live, friendly neighbors, blue skies, walk to the beach, what more can you ask for? Police everywhere to keep it safe, 4 parks within 5 blocks of my apartment.\n",
      "I love it down here. I was born and raised in Detroit Michigan, with all the snow and shivers. Now, getting to live in this beautiful palm tree'd paradise is just a dream come true.\n",
      "I love the sense of community that we have and the easy going life style that everyone has. I have lived on the beach my whole life and never had any problems with security or ever felt un easy, even in the busy night life. Things are very close to each other which makes it easy to walk or ride bike since traffic can be heavy at times.\n",

      "Here are some reviews about Detroit. Use them to help create a list of things to do there:\n",
      "Most my childhood was spent in Detroit visiting family, enjoying the many parks, museums, restaurants, festivals, and Tiger games. I saw Detroit at it's best and I saw its decline. It was heartbreaking for my parents who grew up in Detroit during its heyday. Now I see Detroit through my son's eyes as he frequently visits with friends. We spent the day exploring Midtown, Campus Martius, and Belle Isle. We wanted to show my mother Detroit's comeback. I was amazing to see people out again enjoying the many cafes and restaurants. We wandered through new boutiques and most everyone we met smiled and said \"hello\". My heart is always with Detroit!\n",
      "There is a lot to do downtown, and the city is safe by Wayne and Detroit Mercy. Great food options and they have a lot of versatile events. They recently just had a salsa party where they teach you how to dance! What I like the most is that no matter what the season is, there are a lot of things to do. The public school systems are not always the greatest, I believe that is something that could be worked on. Nightlife is great, there are many bars and restaurants open late. The market is high right now but it is a beautiful area. The commute is about 15 minutes by car with traffic. There's been more diversity over the years and there are a lot of job opportunities that have been only increasing over time.\n",
      "The beloved Motor City. I have lived here for most of my life and have loved living here. Growing up in an urban environment, there are certain experiences that you get with living in the city that you don't get living in the suburbs. The city has made efforts throughout the years to make this place a place to visit again. New parks have been added. Abandoned homes are being torn down, and old roads are being repaired. With all these new improvements being made, there are still some gaps that need to be filled. Tax dollars could be used to provide better lunches for kids in school. Parks are being restored, but are the ones in rundown neighborhoods being rebuilt? I love my city and obviously, there is always room for improvement, but the Motor City is my home and I am proud to live here.\n",
      "I am born and raised from detroit Michigan. Detroit has a lot of things to offer. Detroit is known for its history, music, sports, and art. There are many fun and educational places to visit in Detroit. For example museums, art galleries, and cultural events. Detroit is know as motor city, and is also know for Motown. Some of Detroits famous sports team are known as Tigers, Pistons, and Red Wings.\n",
      "I love my city, it can be very beautiful, connected, strong, and unbeatable. It has good and bad like any other major city but unless you're in a bad lifestyle it isn't hard to not be put in a compromising situation. Plenty of friendly helpful people and great communities, impressive entertainment and food, and amazing organizations.\n",
      "Was once a great city now everything is in its former shell. There are no movie theatres, no grocery stores, no department stores, and mostly everything is abandoned.\n",
      "I like the way the city is coming alive with new funding and projects to develop our city back into the it once was.\n",
      "Detroit is a beautiful city. I have lived here my entire life. I love going to Belle Isle in the summer to spend time with my friends and family. I would like to see a change in the amount of violence that occurs every day here.\n",
      "I have enjoyed the experiences and challenges that have helped shape me into the women I am today. No matter how far away I move Detroit will always be my home!\n",
      "The diversity in Detroit is different and helps you connect to other communities. I would like to see more people like the Latino community, and the Middle Eastern community involved in more of the jobs available here in Detroit.\n",
      "beautiful location. Not enough resources readily available. Buses tend to not truly serve the citizens and alot of the decision making is made by those not even part of the city.\n",
      "it is a great up and coming city with a lot of potential and opportunity. Lots of places to eat, restaurants, festivals, nature places, sports and fun activities to do, great for young professionals.\n",
      "It is a beautiful city with different people and cultures. I have lived in Detroit my whole life and I plan to stay here, but move to a nicer neighborhood when I get older. This is Motor City, so most people drive cars and I like seeing the variety that I don't see in other neighborhoods. In this city, there is a lot of art and music along with passionate people. However, the news and other outlets show bad times and ignore good deeds. I wish people in the city cared about it more. Most entrepreneurs move outside the city to promote their businesses, but use Detroit for brownie points. I love this city. Even if I am sheltered and I have not seen the worst part, there is hope. In my community cops are looked down upon, but in Detroit there is a cop for each demographic of the city: African Americans, Hispanics, Whites, and a few Asians. I appreciate the city seeing problems in other cities and trying its best to prevent them here.\n",
      "I love Detroit for the inspiring stories it has created throughout history. The Downtown area is absolutely stunning and it makes the city feel very welcoming and inviting.\n",
      "I have lived in Detroit, MI all my life. Growing up here was a little rough. We had many abandon houses and empty lots. There also was high crime activity in the city and outskirts. Now Detroit has done a complete turnaround. Our Downtown area was a place you really didn't want to go, unless you had a meeting or wanted to go to the Casino. Now Downtown Detroit is where you want to be. I love when my guest come in town from different states, and I can take them Downtown. The view of the buildings and even to go to the Detroit River walk to take a glance into Canada is amazing. There are all sorts of fun things to do now for all ages. My family loves visiting Downtown we can ride scooters, bikes, and even play some street games. Also, the food choices are unlimited, we literally have restaurants for whatever your appetite desires. In the winter we have an ice-skating rink that the entire family can enjoy. Date night ice skating and drinking hot chocolate is truly amazing. I love DETROIT.\n",

      "Here are some reviews about Detroit. Use them to help create a list of things to do there:\n",
      "Most my childhood was spent in Detroit visiting family, enjoying the many parks, museums, restaurants, festivals, and Tiger games. I saw Detroit at it's best and I saw its decline. It was heartbreaking for my parents who grew up in Detroit during its heyday. Now I see Detroit through my son's eyes as he frequently visits with friends. We spent the day exploring Midtown, Campus Martius, and Belle Isle. We wanted to show my mother Detroit's comeback. I was amazing to see people out again enjoying the many cafes and restaurants. We wandered through new boutiques and most everyone we met smiled and said \"hello\". My heart is always with Detroit!\n",
      "There is a lot to do downtown, and the city is safe by Wayne and Detroit Mercy. Great food options and they have a lot of versatile events. They recently just had a salsa party where they teach you how to dance! What I like the most is that no matter what the season is, there are a lot of things to do. The public school systems are not always the greatest, I believe that is something that could be worked on. Nightlife is great, there are many bars and restaurants open late. The market is high right now but it is a beautiful area. The commute is about 15 minutes by car with traffic. There's been more diversity over the years and there are a lot of job opportunities that have been only increasing over time.\n",
      "The beloved Motor City. I have lived here for most of my life and have loved living here. Growing up in an urban environment, there are certain experiences that you get with living in the city that you don't get living in the suburbs. The city has made efforts throughout the years to make this place a place to visit again. New parks have been added. Abandoned homes are being torn down, and old roads are being repaired. With all these new improvements being made, there are still some gaps that need to be filled. Tax dollars could be used to provide better lunches for kids in school. Parks are being restored, but are the ones in rundown neighborhoods being rebuilt? I love my city and obviously, there is always room for improvement, but the Motor City is my home and I am proud to live here.\n",
      "I am born and raised from detroit Michigan. Detroit has a lot of things to offer. Detroit is known for its history, music, sports, and art. There are many fun and educational places to visit in Detroit. For example museums, art galleries, and cultural events. Detroit is know as motor city, and is also know for Motown. Some of Detroits famous sports team are known as Tigers, Pistons, and Red Wings.\n",
      "I love my city, it can be very beautiful, connected, strong, and unbeatable. It has good and bad like any other major city but unless you're in a bad lifestyle it isn't hard to not be put in a compromising situation. Plenty of friendly helpful people and great communities, impressive entertainment and food, and amazing organizations.\n",
      "Was once a great city now everything is in its former shell. There are no movie theatres, no grocery stores, no department stores, and mostly everything is abandoned.\n",
      "I like the way the city is coming alive with new funding and projects to develop our city back into the it once was.\n",
      "Detroit is a beautiful city. I have lived here my entire life. I love going to Belle Isle in the summer to spend time with my friends and family. I would like to see a change in the amount of violence that occurs every day here.\n",
      "I have enjoyed the experiences and challenges that have helped shape me into the women I am today. No matter how far away I move Detroit will always be my home!\n",
      "The diversity in Detroit is different and helps you connect to other communities. I would like to see more people like the Latino community, and the Middle Eastern community involved in more of the jobs available here in Detroit.\n",
      "beautiful location. Not enough resources readily available. Buses tend to not truly serve the citizens and alot of the decision making is made by those not even part of the city.\n",
      "it is a great up and coming city with a lot of potential and opportunity. Lots of places to eat, restaurants, festivals, nature places, sports and fun activities to do, great for young professionals.\n",
      "It is a beautiful city with different people and cultures. I have lived in Detroit my whole life and I plan to stay here, but move to a nicer neighborhood when I get older. This is Motor City, so most people drive cars and I like seeing the variety that I don't see in other neighborhoods. In this city, there is a lot of art and music along with passionate people. However, the news and other outlets show bad times and ignore good deeds. I wish people in the city cared about it more. Most entrepreneurs move outside the city to promote their businesses, but use Detroit for brownie points. I love this city. Even if I am sheltered and I have not seen the worst part, there is hope. In my community cops are looked down upon, but in Detroit there is a cop for each demographic of the city: African Americans, Hispanics, Whites, and a few Asians. I appreciate the city seeing problems in other cities and trying its best to prevent them here.\n",
      "I love Detroit for the inspiring stories it has created throughout history. The Downtown area is absolutely stunning and it makes the city feel very welcoming and inviting.\n",
      "I have lived in Detroit, MI all my life. Growing up here was a little rough. We had many abandon houses and empty lots. There also was high crime activity in the city and outskirts. Now Detroit has done a complete turnaround. Our Downtown area was a place you really didn't want to go, unless you had a meeting or wanted to go to the Casino. Now Downtown Detroit is where you want to be. I love when my guest come in town from different states, and I can take them Downtown. The view of the buildings and even to go to the Detroit River walk to take a glance into Canada is amazing. There are all sorts of fun things to do now for all ages. My family loves visiting Downtown we can ride scooters, bikes, and even play some street games. Also, the food choices are unlimited, we literally have restaurants for whatever your appetite desires. In the winter we have an ice-skating rink that the entire family can enjoy. Date night ice skating and drinking hot chocolate is truly amazing. I love DETROIT.\n",

      "Here are some reviews about Berlin for the following consideration: Cost. Use them to help create a list of things to do there:\n",
      "[\"RM120 for a return pass is a good deal because you have to pay more for 2 single trip tickets. A return trip Grab ride to the airport will cost you more than RM160 with toll charges. I don't understand why do you regret on having discounts on your ticket?\\n\\nI am not  KL native and haven't used any in recent times but here are my thoughts.\\n\\nKL does not have a rail pass, it uses a credit top up card like the Tough and Go card that can be use for parking, buses, trains and even buying stuffs in shops. What you've purchased was a return trip card which offer like 20-30% off from a normal single one way ticket. The railway also have a monthly user pass for daily commuters. \\n\\nThe cost of each trip is already cheaper than most country on the planet. And the facilities are way better than the one I've ridden in Madrid, Barcelona, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Prague, Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna or even Berlin. I know that's a controversial opinion but it is harder for me to buy a ticket where people don't speak fluent English or uses English in their notice boards. Some of the station are worn down and not properly maintained. Then there's crime and homelessness that I have to deal with. \\n\\nIf you are exiting KLIA (international) or KLIA2 airport (low cost carrier), both are different airport that shares same runways, it is cheaper:\\n\\n* to use the KLIA Express as a solo passenger. Make sure you buy the single stop 28 minutes train to KL Sentral. It is RM90 i believe?\\n* to use Grab service if you are in a 2-3 person group, it will cost you around RM80 or more (plus toll charges) to downtown KL. It will be close to an hour ride. \\n* to use a large taxi (minivan) if 4 pax or more because you have luggage that does not fit in a normal Grab car. It will cost you more or less around RM120. \\n* to use the bus if you are in a tight budget or have some time to kill. I think it is RM15 per trip that usually an hour away from KL Sentral. It leaves every 15 minutes or maybe 30 minutes?\\n\\nKL traffic is not bad compared to other similar cities. It was really bad in the 90s though. There are some choke points like near Bukit Bintang intersection due to the long traffic lights or in the old quarters near Masjid Jamek because of the narrow street and multiple traffic light stops. Other places quite be literally empty and smooth sailing for cars. I can drive from KLCC to IKEA Damansara 15 km away at 11am on weekdays for 20 minutes without seeing any bumper to bumper action. But at 5pm will take you more than an hour to do so. \\n\\nJust avoid using Grab during rush hour, any sane person should know this. Even avoid using MRT/LRT during rush hour too, specially the KLCC station. Just use the elevated walkway if you need to go places nearby. Then avoid driving to big malls around lunch hour or closing time because people are either rushing to get in or get out from there. \\n\\nI hope this will help you for a smooth travel in KL.\"]\n",

Don\\'t bother doing the tour inside Neuschwanstein, just spend the extra time enjoying the exterior and the views.  Rothenberg is a traditional medieval German walled town with half-timbre houses...the ultimate example of what people think of when they think \"Germany.\" The Eagles Nest has the best views I\\'ve seen in my life (it was clear and sunny when we went).  I didn\\'t go to Salzburg but that\\'s another day trip you can do from Munich. Dachau is the very first concentration camp and has a lot of historical significance.

There’s not a lot of paid attractions I’m interested in so that helps, but mainly it’s just about prioritising different things in different countries.\\n\\nGetting from A to B will always be the most expensive thing, after that I just adjust based on where I am\\n\\nI prioritise partying in Eastern European places like Budapest/Prague/Bucharest/etc\\n\\nI prioritise hikes and natural attractions in traditionally expensive places like Switzerland and Scandinavia, and eat dirt cheap/supermarket stuff\\n\\nAs far as big cities go I’ve been to Rome, Paris and Berlin and in all 3 I’ve been able to eat out for 20-30euro or eat street food which is even cheaper. I’m not going to fancy restaurants but honestly I find the small local ones more authentic most of the time. The fancy places tend to be more contemporary and mixed cuisines.\\n\\nI’m obviously staying in hostels the majority of the time but places like portugal or the Balkans are cheap enough that you can easily get a private room if you need the privacy/to recharge, and if you’re travelling with your mates, your money will go a lot further splitting an Airbnb or similar in these countries.\\n\\nI come from Australia so I’m used to alcohol being really expensive on a night out but that’s not reeeally the case in most places here, so you can get away with going out most nights without blowing your budget, so long as you’re not massive binge drinkers. If you are, and even if you’re not but you wanna save a bit more money, but the alcohol beforehand and drink it before you go out\\n\\nEither way, easily doable, just prioritise different things in different places, set a budget, adjust the budget a little once you get here and you understand it better, and then stick with it']\n",

It is dirty, too crowded (especially with tourists) and it doesn't have the kind of attractions that so many other big international cities have. It does have the museums but I can't imagine anyone spending their whole holiday in those. And with regard to nightlife and entertainment it doesn't compare to London, Berlin or Paris. Don't understand why people would want to visit Amsterdam for a vacation.\", 'The spy museum in Berlin was shockingly entertaining and informative—even my wife appreciated it. It wasn’t anything world class, and it was in a strip mall of all places, so expectations were super low…but having said that, it greatly exceeded our expectations.', 'Parking in Paris is pretty difficult, usually a block or two away. The good news is that parking is free at nights, just look for \"PAYANT\" on the road.\\n\\nThe gendarmes are pretty strict with the speed limit, I used to drive around 160 km/h on the wide open highway from Strasbourg to Paris, but with cameras, it\\'s pretty hard to stick with 130 after driving 200 km/h in Germany.\\n\\nIf you can do India, then you can definitely do Paris, ha ha ha.\\n\\nI would think it is more fun to drive from Frankfurt to Berlin, no speed limit on the wide-open three-lane autobahn from Magdeburg to Berlin that\\'s almost empty on a Sunday at 6 in the morning.\\n\\nThe drive is about five hours to Paris so leave in the morning if you want to drive in Paris.
