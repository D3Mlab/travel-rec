        "1) One of the most spectacular beaches I've ever been to, and I've been to alot of beaches! 3 miles of soft, pink sand with turquoise water, boutique hotels and restaurants.Been going since 1996\n",
        "2) Like many beaches on the eastern side it is a pink sand beach. This is in Harbour island so it is famous but not so nice. Too many buildings and people.\n",
        "3) Very clean, very fine sand with a beautiful pink touch. Shallow water perfect for all kind of beach fun. Restaurants and little shacks providing all necessities. Not crowded when we visited, even though peak season.\n",
        "4) Beach is amazing - perfect for walking, strolling, swimming, over 2 miles long. Soft, pink sand, wide beach. Perfection!\n",
        "5) Even though it was supposed to be the busiest time of the year… This beach was still not overly crowded. Absolutely breathtaking views and we were able to find some shade as well. Great little tiki bar on the beach serves food and beverages. If you’re looking for shells or sharks teeth… This is not the place. Spotless smooth sand perfect for sand castle making!\n",
        "6) We went to the Pink sand beach from Nassau one way by ferry, which was extremely expensive and 3 hrs long and on the way back- by plane from North Eleutera which was 20 min long plus waiting time for check-in and boarding. Overall impression about the pink sand beach- disappointing. The sand is not really pink but cream colour. So, if you don't know it is pink you would not guess. There was no bars or restaurants at the beach. Only 1 poor stand with coke, sprite and beer. The only restaurant which we could see around was closed. You had to pay 25 USD for 2 beds and umbrella because extremely hot and impossible to lie on the sun without umbrella. Sand is so fine that it gets everywhere and hard to clean it from the skin. It feels more like a clay. The view of the beach was nice but there are plenty of nicer beaches across Bahamas. We spent only 2 hrs at the beach and left because we were hungry and had to go to into the town to get the meal. The trip cost me 400 eur for 2 persons and it does not worth it.\n",
        "7) Compared to some other beaches in the world, this is not a great beach. Though it's a nice long beach, you can't really walk along the beach as there is always at least a foot of seaweed washed up on the shores. In front of some of the resorts they make rake the seaweed but for the most part it's everywhere. The day we were there, it was extremely windy and it made the stay on the beach miserable, some of the resorts have those shelters where you're covered so I guess this island might see a lot of windy days instead of the occasional one. The ferry ride to harbor island from Nassau is expensive so unless you have absolutely nothing else to do I wouldn't recommend harbor island.\n",
        "8) The sands are a pale pink and fairly soft. There was tons of sea grass in large piles and scattered. We have definitely seen prettier beaches in the Bahamas. It was fairly commercial with lots of umbrellas and lounge chairs. We weren't fans of the island in general...too touristy!\n",
        "9) We wandered along here at low tide and it was gorgeous. There were a lot of starfish who were drying out due to the extreme low tide. Would definitely recommend for a nice walk/ a romantic event.\n",
        "10) We walked in and were stunned by the amazing views of pink sands beach. Vincent and his team were so friendly and attentive. Our lunch was delicious. If you visit Harbour Island, you definitively want to have at least one meal there.\n",
        "\n",
        "Palm Beach, Aruba Reviews:\n",
        "1) It is very difficult for us to find any major negatives for such a pristine beach. It is absolutely stunning, turquoise water and soft white sand, for us it is as good as it gets. However, it is crowded. We get the same beautiful beach with a lot less crowding at Eagle Beach and we have been doing this for many years. It is matter of personal choice, and Eagle Beach with less crowding compared to Palm Beach is our preference.\n",
        "2) I'm not sure what happened... While the water remains picturisque from a distance, when your swimming in it you can barely see your hand in front of your face. The beach sand has also begun to accumulate more debris as well. Don't get me wrong it's a beautiful beach but, something is off compared to my last visit just 22 months ago. Back then you could snorkel right off the beach and see all the way to the bottom. Heck my son found a $20 Bill in the sand under water... That's how clear it used to be. I hope it returns to the way it was back in 2021.\n",
        "3) Palm beach is set on Aruba's western coast in a high tourist area among many hotels. The beach itself is nice, but since being in that busy area means it's pretty crowded and annoying with water sports. I found the Arashi beach and Baby beach to be the island's best.\n",
        "4) The Palm Beach is so beautiful. It’s crystal clear water, soft sand, lots of activities availabile and people, but you don’t feel crowded. Great beach!\n",
        "5) The sand on the beach is like sugar and the water clear and blue. Not very crowded, which I like a lot.\n",
        "6) Beautiful beach. Great staff. Windy. The sand is a bit rough but gets better closer to the water. You need something to hold your towel or it will be blown away.\n",
        "7) I guess I expected clear blue green calm waters. We didn’t get that! Instead we got some waves, sea weed about 25 feet out and a drop down that wasn’t easy to navigate when entering or leaving the water. Not my fav beach.\n",
        "8) This is a spectacularly beautiful beach. we swan and played here multiple days. This is the area of the high rise hotels. The beaches are very clean, the sand is white powder soft, the beach is soft. No stones as you wade into the water. The water is calm, clear and has stunning shades of blue. There are many vendors on the beach for water sports and all other activities. The hotel bars serve the guests on the beach. building sand castles. playing in the water, swimming, snorkeling - its just an amazing time building memories with wife and my 2 kids - son 11 and daughter 4. It was a trip of a lifetime\n",
        "9) Warm, soft water. Slight roll of waves some days to splash in. Sandy bottom. Could swim in here for hours. One of the best beaches in the world.\n",
        "10) This may be the best beach on the island. It's a bit busy but it's gorgeous so it's worth it. Great place to relax and unwind.\n",
